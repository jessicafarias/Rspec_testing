## Intructions to Play

Ir order to play, the game needs two players.

After executing the command to run the game, each player is going to be asked to introduce their name and will have a symbol assigned.

A board with nine numbers boxes will be displayed, and the players are going to be requested on each turn to select one number of the empty boxes.

The number of the selected box will be replaced by the user's symbol. If the user doesn't type the number of an empty box, the choice will be declared invalid and the user will be requested to type again.

The first player who fills an entire column, row, or diagonal with their symbol will be the winner. 

If none of the players matches that condition, the game will be declared a draw.
